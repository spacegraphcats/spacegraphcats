    - X[item] returns a name for the set containing the given item.
      Each set is named by an arbitrarily-chosen one of its members; as
      long as the set remains unchanged it will keep the same name. If
      the item is not yet part of a set in X, a new singleton set is
      created for it.

      into a single larger set.  If any item is not yet part of a set
      in X, it is added to X as one of the members of the merged set.
